# Google-Chrome-Based-File-Explorer
Google chrome based extensions are a small software programs that can modify and enhance the functionality of the Chrome browser. Here we have developed using the web technologies such as HTML5, CSS, and Javascript. Extensions bundle all their files into a single file that the user downloads and installs. Unlike an simple web applications, the extensions donâ€™t have to rely on upon the substance of the web. The extension can be distributed using the Chrome Developer Dashboard where it does allow us to publish to the Chrome Web Store. Google chrome web browser started supporting the extensions in the fourth version. An important point to note is that the extensions are not related to plug-ins. Extensions are completely different to what the browser plug-ins are.
